"""
Shock engine module for shock computation in astrophysical transients.

The :class:`ShockEngine` is an abstract base class which encapsulates all of the necessary
physical tooling to compute the dynamical evolution of shocks in astrophysical transients,
including supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. Specific implementations of shock engines can be
found in submodules of the :mod:`dynamics` and will vary in their structure.

These shock engines can then be instantiated by :class:`~models.core.base.Model` classes to provide
an engine for forward modeling of astrophysical transients.

class ShockEngine(ABC):
    """
    Base class for shock engine implementations.

    A :class:`ShockEngine` encapsulates the necessary physical tooling to compute the dynamics
    of a transient shock given a set of input parameters. In the most generic shock engine, these properties
    are the shock radius :math:`R(t)` and the shock velocity :math:`v(t)`; however, subclasses may add
    additional / different properties as necessary. Specific subclasses may implement various
    dynamical prescriptions from self-similar models to numerical hydrodynamics.

    The central callable method is :meth:`_compute_shock_properties_cgs(self, time, **parameters)`, which
    should compute the shock properties in CGS units given a time and a set of parameters. This method is
    intended to be called internally by :meth:`compute_shock_properties(self, time, **parameters)`, which may handle
    unit conversions and other pre- and post-processing steps while also leaving the core numerical method available
    for performance-critical code paths (i.e. inside JIT-compiled functions).

    The :class:`ShockEngine` is designed to be stateless, meaning that it does not maintain any internal
    parameter state between calls. Instead, all necessary parameters must be provided as inputs to its methods.
    This design allows for easy integration with various modeling frameworks and ensures that the
    shock engine can be reused across different models without unintended side effects. Instantiations may
    still cache intermediate results for performance optimization, but these caches should not affect the
    external behavior of the engine.

    .. note::

        The :class:`ShockEngine` is *extremely flexible* in its design. The hope is that, by introducing
        this abstraction layer, users and developers can implement a wide variety of shock dynamics
        models without needing to modify the core modeling framework. This could include, but is not limited to:

        - Self-similar solutions (e.g., Sedov-Taylor, Chevalier)
        - Numerical hydrodynamics solvers
        - Semi-analytic models
        - Machine learning-based emulators

        all of which have very different internal structures but can be interfaced in a consistent manner via
        the :class:`ShockEngine` abstraction.
