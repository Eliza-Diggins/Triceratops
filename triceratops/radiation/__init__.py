"""
Physics tools and methods for use in radio modeling.

This module contains most of the pure-physics related tools for Triceratops. This includes
the radiative processes, shock dynamics, and other physical calculations needed for
modeling synchrotron emission from supernova shocks and similar phenomena.

.. note::

    For separation of concerns reasons, this module does **NOT** include any modeling. The methods here
    are simply physics building-blocks which can be combined to generate models elsewhere in the library.
