"""
Models of Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) for Triceratops.

This module contains models specifically designed to simulate and analyze tidal disruption
events (TDEs). These models incorporate the unique physical characteristics and behaviors
of TDEs, allowing researchers to study their radio emissions, accretion dynamics,
and other relevant phenomena.
