"""
Abstract base classes for Triceratops models.

This module defines the abstract base class structure for all Triceratops models. It is the
foundation upon which specific physical models are built, ensuring consistency and
standardization across different implementations.

At their core, all of the models in Triceratops inherit from the :class:`Model` abstract base class, which
effectively declares a set of ``parameters``, a set of ``variables``, and a method to compute the model's outputs
based on those parameters and variables.

    Abstract base class for all Triceratops models.

    At their core, all models in Triceratops are wrappers around a set of physical
    parameters and variables, along with a method to compute the model's outputs based on
    those parameters and variables. Formally, a model maps as set of input variables :math:`{\bf x}` and
    a set of model parameters :math:`\boldsymbol{\Theta}` to a set of outputs :math:`{\bf y}` via a function :math:`f`

    .. math::

        {\bf y} = f({\bf x}, \boldsymbol{\Theta}).

    This abstract base class defines the structure that all Triceratops models must adhere to. Specifically, each
    model must declare its parameters and variables as class-level attributes, and implement the
    :meth:`_forward_model` method to compute the model's outputs.

        Notes

        - This method should raise ``ValueError`` for *hard* violations.
        - For physics-driven invalid regions, it is generally preferable
          to allow ``_forward_model`` to return NaNs or infinities instead.
