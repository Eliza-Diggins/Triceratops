def compute_gelman_rubin_rhat(x: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    r"""
    Compute the Gelman-Rubin :math:`\hat{R}` statistic for MCMC convergence diagnostics.

    The Gelman-Rubin :math:`\hat{R}` statistic compares the variance between multiple
    chains to the variance within each chain to assess convergence. Values of
    :math:`\hat{R}` close to 1 indicate convergence, while values significantly
    greater than 1 suggest that the chains have not yet converged. For more details,
    see :footcite:t:`gelman1992inference`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x: np.ndarray
        Array of shape (n, m, dim) containing samples from m chains of length n.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Array of shape (dim,) containing Rhat values.

    Notes
    -----
    Consider a set of :math:`M` Markov chains, each of length :math:`N`, sampling from the
    same target distribution. Let :math:`\theta_{ij}` denote the :math:`j`-th sample from the
    :math:`i`-th chain. The Gelman-Rubin :math:`\hat{R}` statistic is computed as follows:

    First, compute the within-chain variance :math:`W` and the between-chain variance :math:`B`:

    .. math::

        W = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^{M} s_i^2,

    .. math::

        B = \frac{N}{M - 1} \sum_{i=1}^{M} (\bar{\theta}_i - \bar{\theta})^2,

    where :math:`s_i^2` is the sample variance of chain :math:`i`, :math:`\bar{\theta}_i` is the mean of chain
    :math:`i`, and :math:`\bar{\theta}` is the overall mean across all chains.

    With these two statistics, we take a weighted average to estimate the marginal posterior variance
    :math:`\hat{V}`:

    .. math::

        \hat{V} = \frac{N - 1}{N} W + \frac{1}{N} B.

    The Gelman-Rubin :math:`\hat{R}` statistic is then given by:

    .. math::

        \hat{R} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{V}}{W}}.
