    Abstract base class for sampling strategies in Triceratops inference.

    This class defines the interface and common functionality for all sampling algorithms
    used in the Triceratops inference framework. Specific sampling methods should inherit
    from this class and implement the required abstract methods. The :class:`Sampler` class
    is designed to be very general, allowing for a wide range of sampling techniques to be
    integrated into the Triceratops ecosystem.
