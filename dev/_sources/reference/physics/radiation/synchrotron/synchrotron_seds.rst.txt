Synchrotron Spectral Energy Distributions
=========================================

In Triceratops, synchrotron radiation plays a key role in the emission from various transient sources. The spectral
energy distribution (SED) of this emission depends on a number of factors as described in the documentation on
`synchrotron theory <synchrotron_theory>`__. In this document, we'll discuss the various SEDs that are implemented
in Triceratops and the tools available to work with them when building models.

    This guide assumes familiarity with the theory of synchrotron radiation as described in the
    :ref:`synchrotron_theory` section of the documentation.
